# Document a ransomware security incident with an incident handler's journal

## Project Overview

This project involves documenting a security incident using an Incident Handler’s Journal. The journal is a critical tool in the Incident Response process, used to log details about the incident, analyze what went wrong, and provide insights for future mitigation. In this scenario, a U.S. healthcare clinic experienced a ransomware attack initiated by a phishing email. The project focuses on understanding the importance of documentation in the incident handling process and how to use it as part of a cybersecurity portfolio.

## Objectives

- **Incident Documentation**: To document and analyze the security incident from start to finish using an incident handler’s journal.
- **Five W's Analysis**: Answer key questions (Who, What, When, Where, and Why) regarding the incident to build a complete picture of the attack.
- **Incident Response**: Develop skills in recording security events, assessing the causes of incidents, and exploring preventive measures.

### Skills Learned

- Gained experience in documenting security incidents, using structured logs to capture critical details.
- Learned to analyze how phishing attacks occur and how they can lead to broader security breaches like ransomware attacks.
- Acquired skills in recording responses to security incidents and identifying actions that can be taken to prevent future breaches.

### Tools Used

- None

## Steps

### Step 1: Access the Template and Review the Scenario
Download and Open: Accessed the incident handler’s journal template provided in the activity instructions.
Incident Overview: Reviewed the provided scenario of a healthcare clinic facing a ransomware attack initiated by a phishing email.

### Step 2: Record the Journal Entry
- Recorded the date of the journal entry and assigned a journal entry number.

- Provided a description about the entry.

- Mentioned which cybersecurity tools were utilized during the attack analysis.

### Step 3: Document the 5 W's
- **Who:** Recorded that the incident was caused by an organized group of unethical hackers.
- **What:** Documented the ransomware security incident and its consequences.
- **When:** Noted the incident occurred on a Tuesday at 9:00 a.m.
- **Where:** Indicated that the incident took place at a small U.S. healthcare clinic.
- **Why:** Explained that a phishing attack allowed the attackers to gain access to the company’s systems and deploy ransomware, demanding payment for a decryption key.

### Step 4: Additional Notes
- Prevention Measures: Added suggestions for educating staff on phishing threats to prevent similar incidents in the future.
  
- Key Question: Posed the ethical dilemma of whether the company should pay the ransom to retrieve the decryption key.
